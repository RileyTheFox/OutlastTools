## OLGame.CT
### Setup
If you already have CheatEngine installed you can skip to Step 2. 
1. Install  [CheatEngine](https://www.cheatengine.org/ "https://www.cheatengine.org/") 
**WARNING! CheatEngine itself is not a virus but the packages in the installer are just some freeware. All you need to do is decline this in the installation prompt (READ IT) and you will be good. If your AV marks CheatEngine as a virus, it's not... It's just a false positive.** 
2. Open the CheatTable. After installing CheatEngine, download the OLGame.CT file found in this folder. Once you have done so, open CheatEngine, then drag the downloaded file into the big white space in CheatEngine. Or you can just open the file as a CT (Cheat Table). 
2. Click "Click My Box!" then read. Once you get through that, then click the box "Enable... Me!". Once you have done that, explore and have fun! 

### Q&A
